# EmployeeManagementSystem
This is an employee management system based on Java, Servlet, and JSP technologies i used MVC model to create this project.
Front-End - simple by using JSP 
Database-PostgreSQL
                note:- these are the important things that you have to follow carefully to connect this project with your database 
                1. need to install Postgresql 
                2. create a database with the name:-"company"
                3. create a table with the name:- "employee"
                4. create columns 
                                1st column name ="id" <integer>
                                2nd column name="name" <character varying>
                                3rd column name="salary" <double precision>
                                4th column name="number" <bigint> 
                                5th column name="password" <charcter varying>
                                6th column nmae="roll" <charcter varying> 
                warning- the name should be the same as your database as I mention here other 
                         it will not work.
